**Prompt for Generating API Keys with Randomized Last 3 Characters**

I am working with API keys that follow a specific format, and I need help generating several keys where only the last three characters are randomized. Below is a detailed description of the task:

1. **API Key Structure**:
    
    - The first part of each API key is a constant string. For example, `MjAyNDA5MjdmcmVld` remains the same in all keys.
    - The last three characters of the API key need to be randomized for each key. These characters should be a combination of uppercase/lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z) and digits (0-9).
2. **Requirements**:
    
    - I would like to generate 300 unique API keys.
    - Each key will have the first part as `MjAyNDA5MjdmcmVld`, followed by three random characters.
    - The last three characters should be unique for each API key, and they can consist of letters and digits.
3. **Desired Output**:
    
    - The AI should generate 300 API keys in the format `MjAyNDA5MjdmcmVldXXX`, where `XXX` represents the randomized part.
    - Each API key should be printed on a new line for clarity.
4. **Additional Context**:
    
    - The goal is to simulate the creation of API keys in a testing environment, where the base part of the key remains consistent, and only the last three characters change.
    - The randomization should ensure no two keys are identical.

**Example**:  
For example, if the base is `MjAyNDA5MjdmcmVld`, the generated keys might look like this:

- MjAyNDA5MjdmcmVld1aB
- MjAyNDA5MjdmcmVld4F3
- MjAyNDA5MjdmcmVldZx9  
    (Note: These are just examples, the actual keys should have unique, random last 3 characters.)

Please generate 300 such API keys.




**Advanced API Key Enumeration Script Request:**

I am working on a project that requires automating the enumeration of a list of potential API keys to identify a valid "enterprise" API key. Below are the specific requirements for the task, including error handling, performance optimization, and output formatting:

### Key Task:

1. **API Key File**:
    
    - I have a text file (`api_keys.txt`) containing a large list of possible API keys (one per line). The script must read from this file.
2. **API Key Encoding**:
    
    - Each key must be Base64 encoded before being used in the request. The encoded key should be placed in the `x-api-key` header for the API call.
3. **Endpoint**:
    
    - The script will target an API endpoint (e.g., `http://race1/api/laptimes`) using the `GET` method. The endpoint is restricted and will return different responses based on the key type (e.g., free or enterprise).
4. **Response Handling**:
    
    - The script should issue requests until it detects an "enterprise" API key.
    - For each request, analyze the response to differentiate between "free" and "enterprise" plans. If an enterprise key is identified (using content checks in the response body or headers), the script should:
        - Print the valid API key and the response body.
        - Write the successful key and the full API response to a file (`valid_enterprise_key.txt`).
    - If a "free" plan is detected, print a message and continue with the next key.
    - The script should immediately stop once a valid enterprise key is found, avoiding unnecessary requests.
5. **Error Handling**:
    
    - Handle common HTTP response codes gracefully (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, etc.).
    - Implement retry logic for temporary issues (e.g., network timeouts, 5xx errors) with exponential backoff.
    - Log any unexpected errors or failed API calls to a log file (`error_log.txt`) with timestamps for debugging purposes.
6. **Performance Considerations**:
    
    - Optimize for performance when working with a large list of API keys (e.g., by minimizing network overhead, reusing connections, etc.).
    - Use asynchronous HTTP requests or multithreading to speed up the process if supported by the API without exceeding the rate limit.
    - Include configurable rate-limiting options to prevent overwhelming the API server or triggering request blocks.
7. **Security**:
    
    - Ensure the script handles sensitive information (e.g., API keys) securely, avoiding exposure in logs or error messages.
    - Include the ability to obfuscate or mask parts of the key in any output or logging.
8. **Environment**:
    
    - Provide guidance for running the script on different platforms (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows).
    - Include instructions for required libraries (e.g., `requests`, `asyncio`) and dependencies.
9. **Desired Output**:
    
    - The script should output the valid enterprise API key and response body to both the console and a text file (`valid_enterprise_key.txt`).
    - For each failed attempt or free plan detection, the script should print the key and status to the console.

**Example Flow**:

**Example Flow**:


`Reading API keys from 'api_keys.txt'...`
`Checking API key: Base64 encoded key1...`
`Free plan detected. Continuing...`
`Checking API key: Base64 encoded key2...`
`Success! Enterprise API key found: key2`
`Response: {...}`
`Key saved to 'valid_enterprise_key.txt'.`

### Summary:

- The script needs to be robust, optimized, and capable of automating API key enumeration while handling errors, improving performance, and maintaining security. It should stop once a valid enterprise API key is found. Please provide a complete solution along with an explanation of the logic used.
